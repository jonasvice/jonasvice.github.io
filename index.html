										<h2 class="major">A Haunting Reconstruction</h2>
										<p>Modern educational jurisprudence and policy are ostensibly colorblind, but major disparities within the system are still defined along lines of color.  While states point to their own constitutions to defend their education schemes and the mechanics of educating their population, many of the state constitutional articles of education today are the products of over a century’s worth of deliberate undermining of the equitable ideals of the postbellum Union. The purpose of this paper is to examine Mississippi’s public education journey from 1868 to the present day and analyze through the lens of contemporary critical race theory the merits of a pending case faced by the state concerning its education system  and the solutions to its academic disparity that are informed by critical race theorists’ ideas of equity.</p>

										<h2 class="major">An Argument for Place-Based Policymaking in Education and Housing</h2>
										<p>Poverty is the greatest challenge facing public school education today. It sends hungry students to increasingly standardized schools, and the education debt that burdens low-income students is only further deepened by the social, emotional, and physical tolls of their poverty that are not often directly targeted by education policy. This paper will argue that education reform that seeks to eliminate educational inequity between low-income and high-income public schooling must be comprehensive and especially target the inequity by alleviating its causes outside of the halls of school. Specifically, robust education policy should include robust housing policy that focuses on community development and not relocation.</p>

										<h2 class="major">An Exploration of Self-Determination Efforts through the Educational History of the Sami People of Norway</h2>
										<p>Education is regarded as a fundamental component of self-determination.   The Sami People’s history with education during eras of colonization have all but wiped away the history that predates that colonization. In the framework of Western pedagogy, Sami educational philosophies were almost entirely beaten from the Sami people who were often forced into Western instruction. The battle for equal, fair, and just education for the Sami people within the culture of Norway has proven to be a cornerstone of their march towards self-determination.</p>
